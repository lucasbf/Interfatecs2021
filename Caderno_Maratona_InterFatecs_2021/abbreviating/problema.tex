\problem{Abbreviating Names}{Anderson V. Araujo, Caio Tokunaga e Pedro Flores (UFMS)}

Yves is a receptionist at an art gallery and is organizing the opening of a new collection by a famous painter in the city. To save space on the pages and speed up the entry of each guest, he wants to put only an abbreviation of the full names of the guests in the entry list. For each guest, the first and last name must be inserted in full and the others in short form. Help Yves to create a program to accomplish this task.

\section*{Input}
The entry contains several test cases, each case is a guest's name, containing from 2 to 100 characters, without special characters. The entry ends with EOF.

\section*{Output}
The program must print the guest list so that it is ordered by the names with the middle names of each guest abbreviated.
